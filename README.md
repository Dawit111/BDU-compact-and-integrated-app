BDU Compact and Integrated app is a web application that is specifically concerned with the educational process and lifestyles of university students. It is a very compact and interated(all in one) app that was developed for my final year project in Bahirdar University(BDU), hence the name BDU compact and integrated app. The app is full of features such as: Full secure authentication mechanisms, admin management functionalities, a custom social media app inspired by instagram, fully functional  question and answer platform inspired by the likes if stackoverflow, reddit, a lost and found feature that helps a lost object to be found with much ease, a psychological discussions and advisories, and a real time chatting feature.
